My first experience with creating a user interface was in the course "Automating Business Processes". In this class, I learned how to use if/else statements to create a basic "menu" that allowed users to choose an option and be directed to a different "page." Though simplistic in both structure and functionality, it was a great introduction to the thought process and general approach involved in designing a user interface. For my final project, I developed a webpage for a fictional Christmas tree lot, where employees could log in and input tree types, sizes, any add-ons requested by customers, and delivery addresses if specified. The system then generated a receipt containing all order details and delivery information for both the customer and the worker.

### Utilizing R

Continuing my work with user interfaces, I had the opportunity to create a website in R for the final project in my "Data Mining and Visualization" course. I selected a health insurance dataset from Kaggle and built web pages that included an introduction to the data, data exploration, visualizations for each research question, analysis, and a conclusion. This project allowed me to think critically about how I wanted to present my data and insights, and how the outputs from different software tools can vary. Creating the user interface in R felt like a more advanced experience compared to my earlier project in Python.

## Database Management Systems
When I began my Database Management classes, my brother was working as a pilot instructor in my hometown, and I had also been traveling quite a bit. These two factors inspired me to center my database project around “CieloVolo,” a fictional airline company focused on ticketing and flight operations. The name “CieloVolo,” which translates to “sky flight” in English, was a fun way to include a small easter egg referencing my Italian minor.

### Foundations of Information Management

In my Foundations of Information Management class, I learned the basics of constructing databases. I started by deciding on a company to create a database for. I chose a fictional airline company, CieloVolo, and constructed an ERD diagram in Visio with business questions in mind to illustrate the relationships between the entities and attributes in the database/company operations. The point of my database was for management or employees to be able to view passenger tickets, flight destinations and origins, and any bags a passenger may have had. 
<br><br>

I created the CieloVolo database using the ERD and basic SQL in Microsoft Access. From there, I was able to import fabricated data I created in Mockaroo. The next component of the project taught me the skill of querying data, as I had to create queries to use in my reports for the end of the project. The query below was to connect the passenger bag details, bag weight status ('overweight' or 'not overweight'), and the flight destination.

<br><br><br><br><br>

Lastly, I put together reports for easy visualization of the queries' results so that an analyst or company higher up could look at the queries and draw insight from them. Below are two reports; the one on the right shows the "Number of Flights Per Passenger", and the one on the left shows the "Total Profit by Flight Destination State".

In my second database class, I had the opportunity to expand on my CieloVolo database; however, this time I constructed the database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This involved redoing the SQL code for the database, as it was different in Microsoft SQL Server. I went off the same ERD for this project, which made it really easy to transition from Microsoft Access to Microsoft SQL Server. To the right is an excerpt of code I wrote for the database.
<br><br>
In this class, I also got to explore connecting the database to Python for data analysis and also to make alterations to the SQL Server via a Python User-Interface I created. Below shows a graph ordering the destination states by highest revenues.<br><br>

In the final database class, CieloVolo saw a big change in its database setup. My group collaborated with the professor to rewrite the database with a new ERD that could easily be transformed into the data mart using Visual Studios. After turning the database into a data mart, the last part of this project was to create a data analysis visual answering the key business questions we had. To do this, I created a dashboard in Tableau with a number of visuals and key financial values. 

This last iteration of this project was a valuable way to wrap-up my experiences with database management and warehousing. It was a special moment to see my skills transform from a basic understanding of ERDs and databases in Microsoft Access, to creating a data mart in SQL Server. The final user interface dashboard combined my past knowledge of user interfaces with my newly found database skills, and it was the perfect way to wrap up the three-quarter journey of CieloVolo. The dashboard below shows revenues by a number of different variables including location, ticket class, and aircraft model.

In my Optimization Modeling course, I expanded on the basic Excel Solver skills I gained in INFO 1010, and ventured into modeling with Python in Google Colab. Though different than Python in Anaconda, I enjoyed the ability to work on projects from different devices without needing a virtual machine.

For the final project, I explored football and the world of fantasy football through a problem focused on creating the optimal nine-member fantasy team. This project involved several Python libraries, including Pyomo for optimization modeling, and Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy for data analysis and visualization. In the first part of the project, I optimized the team using results from Week 17 of the NFL season—essentially creating a fantasy team with the "cheat code." In the second part, however, I had to define my own constraints to select the best team based on data from the entire season.

For my player selection method, I chose to maximize a new column called "boosted average points per game." I created this column by multiplying "average points per game" by several custom multipliers based on criteria I believed indicated better player performance. These criteria were informed by conversations with friends who are into fantasy football and, of course, some help from Google. Creating this boosted column allowed me to implement soft constraints that guided the optimization without over-restricting the model. To the right is an explanation of the multipliers used for the boosted average points per game, along with the decision variables and additional constraints included in the model.

After creating the objective function and deciding on the constraints, I created the optimization model. Here is the code I used to do so:

<img src="https://github.com/gziliotto12/gziliotto12/blob/main/Assets/Images/alt_modcode.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>

This model proved to be optimal given the constraints. I evaluated its effectiveness by comparing the selected team's actual fantasy points from NFL Week 17 to those of the "cheat code" model. Below, my model is shown on the left, while the "cheat code" model appears on the right.

<img src="https://github.com/gziliotto12/gziliotto12/blob/main/Assets/Images/alt_fantres2.png" alt="drawing" width="450"/> <img src="https://github.com/gziliotto12/gziliotto12/blob/main/Assets/Images/cheat_fantres.png" alt="drawing" align= "right" width="450"/> 

My model did not beat the "cheat code" player selection but, it was still fairly good and outperformed simply maximizing "avg points per game" by 5 points. I ultimately concluded it would be best to time travel and use the cheat code strategy if possible. Realistically, more research on fantasy football performance indicators would be necessary to get the best team lineup; this would likely include data analysis at a more micro-level.

# Accounting Journey
While completing my business core courses, I realized I have a natural interest in accounting and that it pairs well with my BIA major. With guidance from my incredible accounting professors, I began attending networking events like their mixer at the beginning of the year. Through this, I was able to get to know many of the professors and other accounting students.

### PwC CMAAS Deals Summer 2025 Internship
Through one of my accounting professors, I was connected with the PwC recruiter. After looking into the different accountancy options, I chose to apply for their CMAAS Summer 2025 Internship, as it is their advisory side of accounting and offered a great way to combine my interest in accounting and BIA. Though I have not started my internship, I am looking forward to applying the analytical skills I have developed during my time in the BIA department at Daniels College of Business.

### Masters in Accountancy
As I continue to prepare for my future professional career, I have decided to continue my academic journey next year pending acceptance into the Daniels MAcc program. I have been taking several accounting pre-requisites the past few quarters, and am excited as I explore the possibility of going into advisory services or maybe forensic accounting. No matter where I ultimately end up, I know the technical skills I have gained will set me apart as a candidate and guide my decision making.
