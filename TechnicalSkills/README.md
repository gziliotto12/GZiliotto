# Technical
## Skillsets
In the past several years, Daniels College of Business has helped to develop my technical skills in many different ways. My skillset include a combination of several languages and numerous applications that have helped me immensely:

### Utilizing Python

<img src="https://github.com/gziliotto12/gziliotto12/blob/main/Assets/Images/p_calc.png" alt="drawing" align= "right" width= "400"/>My first experience with creating a user interface was in Automating Business Processes. In this course, I learned how to use if/else statements to create a "menu" and allow a user to choose an option and be brought to a different "page". Though very simplistic in structure and usage, it was a great opportunity to get an idea of what to think about when creating a user interface and the general method of creating one. For my final project, I created a webpage for a frictional Christmas tree lot, where workers could login and enter the tree type(s), size(s), any add-ons a consumer wanted, and the address(es) of the order if specified. This then created an output with a reciept for the consumer and the worker so with all the order details and the delivery addresses necessary for each delivery. 

### Utilizing R
Continuing usage of user interfaces, for my final project, I had the opportunity to explore creating a website in R for my course in Data Mining and Visualization. I chose a health insurance dataset from Kaggle, and created pages addressing an introduction to the data, exploration of the data, visualization of each question from the introduction, analysis of data, and a conclusion. This project was an opportunity for me to explore how I would want to represent my data and findings from data anlysis and how the finished products from software programs differ. Creating the user interface in R felt like an elevated experience in comparison to creating one in Python.

## Database Management Systems
At the time of beginning my Database Management classes, my brother was working pilot instructor in my hometown and I had also been traveling quite a bit. These two factors inspired me to build my database project around "CieloVolo", a fictional airline company and its ticket and flight operations. The name, "CieloVolo", translates to "sky flight" in English, which I found to be a fun way to incorporate an small easter egg referencing my minor.

# Accounting Journey
While completing my business core courses, I realized I had a natural interest in accounting and that it paired well with my BIA major. With guidance from my incredible accounting professors, I began attending networking events like their mixer at the beginning of the year. Through this, I was able to get to know man of the professors and other accounting students.

### PwC CMAAS Deals Summer 2025 Internship
Though one of my accounting professors, I was connected with the PwC recruiter. After looking at the different options, I chose to apply for their CMAAS Summer 2025 Internship, as it is their advisory side of accounting and offered a great way to combine my interest in accounting and BIA. Though I have not started my internship, I am looking forward to applying the analytical skills I been developing during my time in the BIA department at Daniels College of Business.

### Masters in Accountancy
As I continue to prepare for my future professional career, I have decided to continue my academic journey next year pending acceptance into the Daniels MAcc program. I have been taking several accounting pre-requisites the past few quarters, and am excited as I explore the possibility of going into advisory services or maybe forensic accounting. No matter where I ultimately end up, I know the technical skills I have gained will set me apart as a candidate and guide my decision making.
