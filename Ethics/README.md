### Artifical Intelligence Usage
During my time at the University of Denver, the world witnessed the revolutionary rise of artificial intelligence chatbots. AI has been an incredible resource throughout my Business Information and Analytics (BIA) journey and has frequently been integrated into coursework. Many of my professors encouraged us to solve coding problems using AI chatbots and taught us how to craft effective promptsâ€”both to challenge the AI and to generate productive results. This experience not only emphasized the importance of prompt formulation but also highlighted the differences between various chat platforms.

That said, using AI also comes with risks, particularly around plagiarism and ethical concerns. Transparency in AI usage is important to me. When I use AI for coding, I make sure I understand the code it provides and the reasoning behind any changes it suggests. Additionally, I strongly believe that quality research should not rely on AI chatbots alone. My mom, a college librarian, taught me from a young age how to find reputable sources and emphasized the value of well-conducted research. While I sometimes use AI to locate potential databases or identify helpful articles, I ensure that the actual research used in my individual and group projects comes from credible sources. This is crucial for ensuring that analysis and decision-making are grounded in accurate and relevant insights.
