Growing up in a culturally diverse family, my deep curiousity and desire to learn about and immerse myself in other cultures has been a integral component of my identity. I was particularly drawn to the University of Denver by the strong student encouragement to complete a cultural exchange and the high prevelence of out-of-state students.
