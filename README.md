### About Me
Hello, my name is Giuliana Ziliotto. I grew up in the breathtaking city of Santa Barbara, California; which is known for its spectacular ocean views, delectable cuisine, and incredible hikes. With my desire to experience the different seasons and all that Denver had to offer, I headed to the University of Denver to pursue my Bachelors degree. 

It has been quite the journey as I pondered where my interests truly lied. I started out as a Bio-Chemistry major; however, after dabbling in University Physics and Mathematics, I ultimately landed on Business Information & Analytics, with pending plans to pursue a Masters of Accountancy in Fall 2025. 

It goes without saying that I have had a deep curiosity for learning from a young age, and if a "jack of all trades" major existed, it would surely fit who I am as a person. That being said, as I've had the opportunity to explore my interests and have sought to enrich my studies in my time here at DU. I've explored global business arenas that align with my personal interests, been challenged as I worked to hone key technical abilities, and been pushed out of my comfort zone through my newly-forged leadership skills as a co-chair on the executive board for University of Denver's Programming Board (DUPB). Through these experiences, skills, and gain self-assurance I know I am prepared for whatever comes my way in the workplace and future educational endeavors.

During my free time, I enjoy a multitude of hobbies. I have condensenced my hobbies into more managable catagories:

- Singing: I sang in choirs K-12 and recieved lessons on classical pieces and Opera. Though I am not part of choir at DU, it is still a huge part of my life and something that brings me immense joy.
- Cooking & Baking: Growing up in an immigrant household, food has been a key component of my life since I could remember. Naturally, I grew up learning many recipes from my family and as I have grown older, I find excitement in exploring different cultures through their food.
- Arts & Crafts: Anyone from my childhood could explain the creativity I have possessed my entire life. Whether it was hyper-realistic drawings, abstract art, pottery, jewelry-making, sewing, photography...the list goes on; I think part of why BIA appealed to me in the first place was the fact that displaying data and telling a story through it is really an art form of sorts. 
- Nature: Whether it's walks around Washington Park or the beach in California, hikes in the mountains, or hitting the slopes when I can, I find peace and tranquility in surrounding myself with nature.
