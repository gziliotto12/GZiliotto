# Community Engagement & Leadership
### University of Denver Programming Board (DUPB)
Beginning my sophomore year (Fall 2022), I decided I wanted to become more involved in the University of Denver community. One of my freshman friends was involved in DUPB and recommended I apply to join the club. I began my journey on the as a member on the Mainstage committee, where we focused on planning music and performace related events for the student body. I ended up taking on the "Finance Liaison" position on the Mainstage committee, and I learned a lot about how clubs allocate their funds.

After my sophomore year on DUPB, I decided to go for a leadership position, and was chosen to be a co-chair on the Explorations committee. I was intimidated going into the position, as it is something that I didn't have much prior experience with. As I learned how to work with our advisor and my fellow co-chair, I saw my confidence and communication skills blossom. It was a challenging experience, but ultimately taught me how to coordinate with vendors and navigate securring contracts for events. Additionally, my co-chair and I were able to bring a blanket making event to campus that was so popular, it has been adopted as of the events that will be repeated possibly every year.

During my senior year and final year of DUPB, I have had the most fun with it as a Mainstage co-chair. It is truly a full-circle moment being the co-chair of the club I was once a committee member of, and it is so rewarding to be on this side of it. My fall co-chair and I worked hard to plan the a karaoke night with number we hadn't see in a long time for a karaoke night. We also partnered with different DU organizations for put togehter the DU Palooza during homecoming weekend and developed novel ideas for the event. In particular, I spent well over 40 hours creating a custom pi√±ata of the DU's homecoming hockey opponent's mascot. Since then, the new co-chairs and I worked to put on the tradition of "Battle of the Bands", which had the largest turnout we had seen for the event. Students got to enjoy food and live music (the best of both worlds).
