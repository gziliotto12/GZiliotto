# Community Engagement & Leadership
### University of Denver Programming Board (DUPB)
Beginning my sophomore year (Fall 2022), I decided I wanted to become more involved in the University of Denver community. One of my freshman friends was involved in DUPB and recommended I apply to join the club. I began my journey on DUPB as a member on the Mainstage committee, where we focused on planning music and performace related events for the student body. I ended up taking on the "Finance Liaison" position for the committee, and I learned a lot about how clubs allocate their funds.

I was intimidated going into the position, as I didn't have much leadership experience prior to the position. I learned how to effectively work with my fellow co-chair and our advisor and quickly saw my confidence and communication skills blossom. It was at times challenging, but I learned how to work with vendors, navigate securring contracts for events, and how to appropriately manage a budget of thousands of dollars. From my first year of being a co-chair, we were able to bring a blanket-making event to campus that was very popular, and it has been adopted as an annual event.

During my senior year of DUPB, I've had the most fulfilling time as a Mainstage co-chair. It's truly a full-circle moment being the co-chair of the club I was once a committee member of, and it is so rewarding to see my committee members find the same joy I did when I joined. My fall co-chair and I worked hard to plan a karaoke night with turn out numbers we hadn't see before. We also collaborated with different DU organizations to put together the DU Palooza during homecoming weekend and develop new ideas to incorporate into the event. I also spent well over 40 hours creating a custom pi√±ata of the homecoming hockey opponent's mascot that people got to hit at the DU Palooza event. 

The new co-chairs and I worked to put together the annual "Battle of the Bands", which had the largest turnout we had seen for the event. This event gave DU students the chance to showcase their musical talent, with the chance to open for Mainstage's annual MusicFest. Students got to enjoy food and live music- the best of both worlds. 

We have also been working hard at this year's MusicFest, with headliner, Jeremy Zucker, and supporting artist, Arlie. This process has taught me a lot about time management when booking artists, managing expectations, and working through difficult situations. Music artists get booked over 6 months in advance, which can make it challenging to gather student input on genre and artist options. As co-chairs, we were ready to move forward with an artist we were incredibly excited for, but during that process, they committed to going on tour with a different artist. Although it was a devastating moment, we had to pivot quickly to find an alternative artist and get the contracts in as quickly as possible. It's a hard position to be in because it is impossible to choose an artist every student will be happy with, but it has shown me the importance of standing by your decisions and not taking other people's opinions to heart.

### Reflection
My time on DUPB as a former committee member and current co-chair, have shown me the immense value of joining clubs and social organizations. Not only have I watched committee members become friends, but I've seen how much students gain value from attending and planning these events. It gives new and older undergraduate students the chance to get to know one another and discover new hobbies and interests. College can be stressful, so learning how to create a safe space for others is something I've been working on during my time in DUPB.
